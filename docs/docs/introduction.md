# Introduction

SabaccUI isn't your typical component library â€” it's a treasure crate of animated, ready-to-use components for your apps. You can copy and paste the components into your web projects.

It primarily features components built with Vue and Tailwind CSS for creating landing pages and user-facing marketing materials.

## How is it different to a component library?

- **No installation required**: SabaccUI isn't distributed via npm or installed as a dependency.
- **Cherry-pick components**: Choose only the components you need, keeping your project lean and efficient.
- **Seamless integration**: Use our CLI to automatically add components, or simply copy and paste the code directly into your project.
- **Full customization**: The code becomes part of your project, giving you complete freedom to customize and adapt it to your specific needs.
- **Learning resource**: Use SabaccUI as a reference to build and understand your own component libraries.
